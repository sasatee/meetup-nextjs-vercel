Now, here in getStaticProps,

you can do whatever you want,

for example, fetch data from an API

or from a database or read data from some files

in the file system, like we do it

in my full NextJS course, for example.

But then once you're done with whatever you did

to get the data you need,

you need to return an object here in getStaticProps.

You always need to return an object here.

Now, in this object,

you can configure various things

but most importantly,

you typically set a props property here

and it has to be named props.

And that then holds another object,

which will be the props object you receive

in your component function here

in this page component function.

This now receives a props object

and the object will be the object you set as props here

in getStaticProps.

And there we could have our meetups key in there.

The structure of this props object is totally up to you,

which holds our DUMMY_MEETUPS.

With that, those DUMMY_MEETUPS would be loaded

and prepared in getStaticProps

and then they would be set as props

for this page component.

Therefore, in this page component,

we no longer need to manage state,

we no longer need useEffect

and we can therefore get rid of those imports here

because now we get the data through props.

And our meetups for the MeetupList component

are props.meetsups.

.meetups because I'm adding a meetups prop down there.

And that's how we can move the data fetching away

from the client to the server-side

or to be precise to the during the build process side.

If I now save everything,

if we reload our page, we still see our meetups here

but if I now view the page source,

we see that we no longer have an empty unordered list,

instead we have an unordered list,

which has list items

with the images and the title and so on.

So now this is pre-rendered

and it now contains the full HTML code

and that's, of course, also great for search engines then

because now, data is not fetched

in a second component render cycle on the client

but initially, before this page is pre-rendered,

during the build process.

And that's a great plus and one of the main features

of NextJS, this data fetching for pre-rendering.

And getStaticProps will be a function you use a lot
